                "I was looking to learn English, and I hadn't had much luck with
                it until then. One day, I saw this, and I remember thinking that
                it was probably someone pretending to be a beautiful woman,
                waiting to trick me. I wanted to reply, but I always put
                everything off, and then almost a month passed. Your next
                response came almost two months later. Just one line was enough
                for me to realize I was talking to someone special: 'Hola, sí,
                disculpa por tardarme. Siento que no hay tiempo para nada y solo
                paso el tiempo mirando la pared' After that, our conversations
                happened every day, and that's what has given me strength in my
                darkest moments."

                you really that pretty, is it possible?' It's so interesting,
                and your conversations are so enjoyable and fun, and on top of
                that, you look like this? The day after that photo, you were
                mentioning something about being Pedro Infante, and I thought I
                must be misunderstanding, I mean, how could that be possible? I

                blanket with your hair simply tied up, and you look so good. The
                calentón's light works so well. The next day, when I was home
                alone, I watched a YouTube video about photography, and I
                thought you deserved a photo session to see what I see when I
                look at you, to see how good you look, the presence you have,
                but above all because an image like you deserves the best photo
                session anyone can take. I want to be your photographer for
                life."

                couple and not like Beauty and the Beast. I was wearing my
                favorite shirt. I've always thought that we make a great pair...
                our conversations can be fun, deep, or a bit of both at the same
                time. I've always thought our personalities are interesting and
                exciting. I always think of us as a team that gets along well.
                This photo also made me realize that we can look really good...
